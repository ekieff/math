# About This Project
I was inspired to make this project after my coworker told me about the [Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) and this viral [video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/094y1Z2wpJg)
One of the benefits I admire about being able to code is the ability to create and visualize problems. 

# Technologies Used
This is a simple react app, by using state I've been able to make an app that can update with changes. I hope to build upon the functionality of react in future updates by adding more problems in components.

# Next Steps
I didn't spend a lot of time on the design of this app, but hope to continue to build out a nice user interface and add more features that would be fun to view.

# How to Help
Do you have a math problem that you'd like to visualize? Make a fork and let me know what inspires you.
